# Hello

[LeanCode][LeanCode page] is a software studio from Warsaw, Poland. We deliver end-to-end solutions, starting with concept exploration and ending with a ready-to-use digital product. We work with enterprises and startups.

We're engaged in building the Flutter community (especially [Flutter Warsaw][Flutter Warsaw page]) and in developing open-source libraries for Flutter, .NET, and React. What matters to us is the teamwork and willingness to develop knowledge and skills in which we are happy to support the community.

## Patrol

We ❤️ open source! One of our most popular open-source projects is [Patrol][Patrol page] our Flutter UI testing framework. Patrol builds on top of Flutter's existing test tooling to enable you to do things that were previously impossible, such as testing mobile native features.
